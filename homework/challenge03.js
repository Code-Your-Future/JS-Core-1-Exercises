/* Challenge 3: Needle in a Haystack

Can you find the needle in the haystack?

Write a function `findNeedle()` that takes an array full of junk but containing one "needle", which you need to find with a for loop.

After your function finds the needle it should return a message (as a string) that says: `"Found the needle at position x"`, with `x` being the index number at which you find the needle.

So:

var haystack = ['hay', 'rabbit', 'needle', 'hat'];

findNeedle(haystack);

Should return:

'Found the needle at position 2'
*/

/*Solution:*/

var findNeedle = function(arr) {
    if(arr.includes("needle"));
    return arr.indexOf("needle");
}

var position = findNeedle(['hay', 'rabbit', 'needle', 'hat']);
    
    console.log('Found the needle at position '+ position);
};
