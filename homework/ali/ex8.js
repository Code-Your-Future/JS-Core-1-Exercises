// Write a function which takes a integer number as a guess. It then checks if their guess matches 
// with a randomly generated integer number (Hint: try Math.random()).
//  If it does match it logs out with a success message (e.g. "Good guess!").
//  If their guess does not match, log a different message (e.g. "Incorrect, try again!").
